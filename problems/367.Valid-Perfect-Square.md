## Solution

### Approach 1: Binary Seach

To my sense, this is the most intuitive solution I can think of. The idea of binary search to this problem is very simple, each time we take the average (integer) of two boundary values, one of which is the lower search bound, the other is the upper search bound. Then we square this median and compare the result with our target value, recursively, if to some step they are equal, then our target is a perfect square, otherwise it's not.

The reason for binary search is also intuitive, for time efficiency and space efficiency. Overall, this algorithm can run in $O(log n)$ time and $O(log n)$ space (depends on the recursion depth).

There is one issue we should notice: the data type `int` may not work for the square operation so we need to use `long long int` instead. Program with `int` actually will report runtime error.

The code is shown below:

```c++
// Valid Perfect Square
// 53.63% time, 76.19% space
// Accepted

#include <iostream>
#include <math.h>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    // This helper function evaluate whether the square of the average of low and high equals the target 
    bool evaluate(int low, int high, int target) {
        // base case
        int median = (low+high) / 2;
        if (low == high || median == low || median == high)    return false;
        if (median*median == target)    return true;
        else if (target > median*median)    return evaluate(median, high, target);
        else    return evaluate(low, median, target);
    }

    bool isPerfectSquare(int num) {
        if (num < 0)
            return false;
        else if (num == num*num)
            return true;

        return evaluate(0, num, num);
    }
};


int main() {
    Solution test;
    int res1 = test.isPerfectSquare(16);
    int res2 = test.isPerfectSquare(14);
    cout << res1 << endl;
    cout << res2 << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

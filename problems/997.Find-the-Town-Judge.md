## Solution

### Approach 1: Brute Force

The idea to solve this problem is really simple, we just need to count how many times one person is trusted by the others. If only one person is trusted by all people except for himself, and also if he doesn't trust anyone else. Then he must be the town judge. Based on this simple idea, we need to keep two arrays to keep track of how many times one person is trusted by others as well as whether he trusts others or not. The overall runtime is $O(n)$. The space complexity is $O(n)$.

The code is shown below:

```c++
// Find the Town Judge
// 31.96% time, 37.50% space
// Accepted

#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int findJudge(int N, vector<vector<int> >& trust) {
        int *be_trusted = new int[N+1];
        int *trusting = new int[N+1];
        for(int i=1; i<=N; i++) {  // initialization
            be_trusted[i] = 0;
            trusting[i] = 0;
        }

        for(auto iter:trust) {
            be_trusted[iter[1]] += 1;
            trusting[iter[0]] += 1;
        }
        
        int judge;
        int possible_judge = 0;
        for(int i=1; i<=N; i++) {
            if(be_trusted[i] == N-1) {
                possible_judge++;
                judge = i;
            }
        }
        
        if (possible_judge != 1 || trusting[judge] != 0)
            return -1;

        return judge;
    }        
};

int main() {
    Solution test;
    // Example 1
    // vector<vector<int> > trust = {{1,2}};
    // int N = 2;
    // Example 2
    // vector<vector<int> > trust = {{1,3}, {2,3}};
    // int N = 3;
    // Example 3
    vector<vector<int> > trust = {{1,3}, {2,3}, {3,1}};
    int N = 3;
    // Example 4
    // vector<vector<int> > trust = {{1,2}, {2,3}};
    // int N = -1;
    // Example 5
    // vector<vector<int> > trust = {{1,3}, {1,4}, {2,3}, {2,4}, {4,3}};
    // int N = 3;
    int res = test.findJudge(N, trust);
    cout << res << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

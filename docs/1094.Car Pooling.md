## Solution

### Approach 1: Difference Array

The code is shown below:

```c++
class Solution:
    def carPooling(self, trips: List[List[int]], capacity: int) -> bool:
        diff = [0] * 1001
        for trip in trips:
            num_passengers, first, last = trip
            diff[first] += num_passengers
            diff[last] -= num_passengers
        res = [0] * 1001
        res[0] = diff[0]
        if res[0] > capacity:
            return False
        for i in range(1, 1001):
            res[i] = res[i-1] + diff[i]
            if res[i] > capacity:
                return False
        return True
```

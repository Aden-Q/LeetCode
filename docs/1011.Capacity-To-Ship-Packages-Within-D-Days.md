## Solution

### Approach 1: Greedy

The code is shown below:

```c++
class Solution:
    def calDays(self, weights, capacity):
        left = 0
        days_total = 0
        while left < len(weights):
            cur_capacity = capacity
            while left < len(weights):
                if cur_capacity < weights[left]:
                    break
                else:
                    cur_capacity -= weights[left]
                    left += 1
            days_total += 1
        return days_total
    
    def shipWithinDays(self, weights: List[int], days: int) -> int:
        weight_sum = sum(weights)
        left = max(weights)  # can load the largest item in the list
        right = weight_sum + 1  # can load in one round
        while left < right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            if self.calDays(weights, mid) > days:
                left = mid + 1
            else:
                right = mid
        return left
```

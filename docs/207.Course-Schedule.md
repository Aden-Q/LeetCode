## Solution

### Approach 1: Graph DFS, Cycle

The code is shown below:

```python
class Solution:
    def canFinish(self, numCourses: int, prerequisites: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
        graph = [[] for _ in range(numCourses)]
        for edge in prerequisites:
            graph[edge[1]].append(edge[0])
        visited = [False] * numCourses
        on_path = [False] * numCourses
        has_cycle = False
        
        def traverse(node):
            nonlocal visited, on_path, has_cycle, graph
            if on_path[node]:
                has_cycle = True
                return
            if visited[node] or has_cycle:
                return
            # visited the current node
            visited[node] = True
            on_path[node] = True
            # visited its neighbor
            for neighbor in graph[node]:
                traverse(neighbor)
            # end visiting the current node, remove it from the current DFS path
            on_path[node] = False
            return
        
        for node in range(numCourses):
            traverse(node)
        # if there is no cycle, then you can finish all courses
        return not has_cycle
```

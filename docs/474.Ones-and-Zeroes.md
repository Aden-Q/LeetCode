## Solution

### Approach 1: Dynamic Programming

The code is shown below:

```c++
class Solution:
    def findMaxForm(self, strs: List[str], m: int, n: int) -> int:
        dp = [[0 for _ in range(n + 1)] for _ in range(m + 1)]
        for s in strs:
            zero_count = 0
            one_count = 0
            for c in s:
                if c == '0':
                    zero_count += 1
                else:
                    one_count += 1
            for i in range(m, zero_count - 1, -1):
                for j in range(n, one_count - 1, -1):
                    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i-zero_count][j-one_count] + 1)
        return dp[m][n]
```

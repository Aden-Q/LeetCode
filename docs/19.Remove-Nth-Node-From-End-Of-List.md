## Solution

### Approach 1: Naive Approach

The idea is staightforward, the given input index counts from the end, the first thing we gonna do is to figure out the size of the linked list and convert the backward index into a forward index. This require a one way traversal into the linked list. Once we have the forward index, we can do another round of forward traversal to delete the corresponding node in the linked list. The only thing we need to pay attention to is when we delete a head or when we don't have an empty linked list after deleteion. Both cases are not difficult to handle with. The running time is $O(n)$, with two one-way traversals.

The code is shown below:

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def removeNthFromEnd(self, head: Optional[ListNode], n: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        # counting from the head
        size = 0
        cur = head
        while cur:
            cur = cur.next
            size += 1
        idx = size - n
        prev = None
        cur = head
        for i in range(idx):
            prev = cur
            cur = cur.next
        if prev:
            prev.next = cur.next
        elif head:
            head = head.next
        else:
            head = None
            
        return head
```

## Solution

### Approach 1: BFS

The code is shown below:

```python
from collections import deque

class Solution:
    def numOfMinutes(self, n: int, headID: int, manager: List[int], informTime: List[int]) -> int:
        graph = [[] for _ in range(n)]
        dist = [0] * n
        for i in range(n):
            if manager[i] != -1:
                graph[manager[i]].append(i)
        q = deque([headID])

        while len(q) != 0:
            sz = len(q)
            max_inform_time = 0
            for _ in range(sz):
                curr_node = q.popleft()
                for node in graph[curr_node]:
                    dist[node] = dist[curr_node] + informTime[curr_node]
                    q.append(node)

        return max(dist)
        
```

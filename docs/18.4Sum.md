## Solution

### Approach 1: Two Pointers

This is the most intuitive approach coming to my mind. To index four numbers, we keep track of each number with a pointer, sorting from left to right. First we sort the input array, to make pruning easier.The first round of the iteration keeps track of the indices for the first and last numbers with two pointer called `a ` and `d`. Then we maintain two pointers,  `start` ,`end`. The initial values are `left = a+1`, `right = d-1`.Then we calcualte the sum and compare it with the target, if the sum is less than 0, move the left pointer to the right. If the sum is greater than 0, then move the right pointer to the left. We also need to skip several steps just to eliminate redundancy.

When the pointers `start` and `end` cross over, we begin our next round by adjusting the window size `a` - `d`. First we adjust `d`, then `a`. The run time for this approach is $O(n^3)$.

The code is shown below:

```python
class Solution:
    def fourSum(self, nums, target):
        if len(nums) == 0:
            return []
        res = []
        nums.sort()
        a = 0
        d = len(nums) - 1
        while a <= len(nums) - 4:
            if d < a + 3:
                # revoke
                d = len(nums) - 1
                # get new a
                while a <= d -3 and nums[a] == nums[a+1]:
                    a += 1
                a += 1
                if a >  d - 3:
                    break
            b = a+1
            c = d-1
            num1 = nums[a]
            num4 = nums[d]
            while b < c:
                num2 = nums[b]
                num3 = nums[c]
                sum_temp = num1 + num2 + num3 + num4
                # print(sum_temp)
                if sum_temp < target:
                    # move the start poniter to the right
                    b += 1
                elif sum_temp > target:
                    c -= 1
                else:
                    res.append([num1,num2,num3,num4])
                    while b < c and nums[b] == nums[b+1]:
                        b += 1
                    while b < c and nums[c] == nums[c-1]:
                        c -= 1
                    b += 1
                    c -= 1
            while d >= a + 3 and nums[d] == nums[d-1]:
                d -= 1
            d -= 1
        return res
```
